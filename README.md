# Personal Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio of myself. While I do have a profile on LinkedIn, I felt having something more public could be helpful, especially if people would like to know my history and my accomplishments (which may be useful if for instance they would like to look me up while listenting to a talk or webinar).

I settled on using the [Dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension) template from HTML5 Up. The reason why is that I liked the look of it, as well as it being simplistic (it only involves having to edit a single HTML file for the content).
